# Project TacTicA

This is [optiklab's](https://github.com/optiklab) sandbox organization to play with various languages, frameworks, design approaches and architectures.
Everything is open sourced, as it all rely's on knowledge that is publicly available in books, articles, videos and of course - code itself.

## What it's all about

I'm an experienced software developer (10+ years), but I forget things frequently if not using daily. I also love to experiment with new technologies and think about how to use it in production.

I've created this set of projects to systemize the knowledge about the fundamentals of programming and quickly recover this information when I need it.

So, I'm not pretending to be 100% accurate at every line of code. Still, most of the examples result from aggregating several resources (books, articles, source code repo's) to find the easiest to understand, best for remembering, and, if possible, not the worst efficient solution. 

Most of the examples should be working and updated when needed, so they are deployable applications or usable libraries.
